<h1>Introduce myself
How long have you been here
I joined Barclays also BIA at the beginning of 2018 as a VP for US CCAR team. 
I became an AO in 2019 - I was AO for about 20 audits. I worked for the Finance team for about one year working on the CECL. 
Since 2023, I have been with the BIA central DA team taking care of RFT/financial crime/compliance portfolios.  


<h2>DA role
I use my data analytics skills to support our audit teams with complex data requirements. 
It's been really exciting to collaborate with different teams across Barclays to develop analytical tools that streamline our audit processes. 
I also enjoy applying advanced techniques like machine learning to improve our audits and providing training and mentoring to my colleagues to boost their coding skills.


<h2>CCAR 
Before this, I was with Barclays as VP for CCAR & Finance Audit from 2018 to 2022. Here, I handled executing audit plans and overseeing our audit portfolio, which included CCAR, CECL, and regulatory capital. One of the key aspects of my role was continuous monitoring and ensuring our audit universe was complete. 
I also played a part in formulating annual audit plans and resource allocation, which was quite dynamic and engaging. 
Additionally, I stayed on top of regulatory changes and led efforts for annual CCAR capital plan submissions, which involved drafting responses to regulators and preparing for exam meetings. I enjoyed building strong relationships with key business stakeholders and representing internal audit at various governance forums.


<h2>Going back further, I was at JP Morgan in Model Risk Governance & Review from 2014 to 2018. My work there was primarily focused on validating firm-wide CCAR models, which included a variety of models like those for Corporate & Investment Bank sales and trading, corporate banking, and auto loan projections. I also delved into evaluating the framework and methodology for economic scenario design processes and ensured everything aligned with US Basel III Rules.
