<h1>Internal Audit's Role</h1>
https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/srletters/2011/sr1107a1.pdf
A bank's internal audit function should assess the overall effectiveness of the model risk management framework, including the framework's ability to address <strong>both types of model risk </strong>described in Section III, for individual models and in the aggregate. 

<strong>Audit Report</strong> Findings from internal audit related to models should be documented and reported to the board or its appropriately delegated agent. 

<h2>IA's role </h2>
<li>Banks should ensure that internal audit operates with the proper incentives, has appropriate skills, and has adequate stature in the organization to assist in model risk management. </li>
<li>Internal audit's role is not to duplicate model risk management activities. Instead, its role is to evaluate whether model risk management is comprehensive, rigorous, and effective. </li>

<h2>IA's competency and independence</h2>
<li>To accomplish this evaluation, internal audit staff should possess sufficient expertise in relevant modeling concepts as well as their use in particular business lines. </li>
<li>If some internal audit staff perform certain validation activities, then they should not be involved in the assessment of the overall model risk management framework.</li>

<h2>What IA should look at?</h2>
<li>Policy and compliance: Internal audit should verify that acceptable policies are in place and that model owners and control groups comply with those policies. </li>
<li>Timely Validation: Internal audit should also verify records of model use and validation to test whether validations are performed in a timely manner and whether models are subject to controls that appropriately account for any weaknesses in validation activities. </li>
<li>Model Inventory: Accuracy and completeness of the model inventory should be assessed. </li>
<li>Model Usage: In addition, processes for establishing and monitoring limits on model usage should be evaluated. </li>
<li>Model Changes: Internal audit should determine whether procedures for updating models are clearly documented, and test whether those procedures are being carried out as specified. </li>
<li>Model Documentation: Internal audit should check that model owners and control groups are meeting documentation standards, including risk reporting. 
<li>System and input data: Additionally, internal audit should perform assessments of supporting operational systems and evaluate the reliability of data used by models.</li>
<li>Validation: Internal audit also has an important role in ensuring that validation work is conducted properly and that appropriate effective challenge is being carried out. 
  <li>It should evaluate the objectivity, competence, and organizational standing of the key validation participants, with the ultimate goal of ascertaining whether those participants have the right incentives to discover and report deficiencies. </li>
  <li>Internal audit should review validation activities conducted by internal and external parties with the same rigor to see if those activities are being conducted in accordance with this guidance. </li>
